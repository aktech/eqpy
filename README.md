`eqpy` makes managing systems of equations and assumptions as painless as possible,
and can numerically and symbolically solve linear and non-linear systems of equations.

`eqpy` relies heavily on `sympy`, but also provides APIs that match `math`, `cmath`,
and `numpy` packages, which may be more familiar to some users.
